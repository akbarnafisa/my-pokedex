### UI

All UI components are located inside the `components` folder, which contains three subfolders:
- `common`: This folder contains components that are shared across all pages.
- `icon`: This folder contains a list of all icons.
- `ui`: This folder contains reusable components.

There are two components that handle business logic:
- `PokeCard.vue`: This component handles API requests to get detailed information about a Pokemon. Due to the design of the API response, we need to fetch the data individually.
- `SelectType.vue`: This component handles the display of a list of Pokemon types and also manages redirection to the type page.
